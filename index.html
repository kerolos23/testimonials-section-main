                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br>
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been lookimg to make a<br>
                transtition and heard some people who had an  amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>
                the free intro course and found it invredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12<br>
                weeks was the best-and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br>
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br>
                themselves. Gtting guidance from them and learning from<br>
                their experiences was easy.

                <sup>~</sup> The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br>
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br>
                myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. you will get the<br>

                Such a life-changing<br>

                <sup>~</sup> Before joining the bootcamp, I've<br>
                never written a line of code. I needed<br>
                some structure from professionals<br>
                who cam help me learn programming<br>
                step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
                enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
                who can only say wonderful things<br>
                about the program. The entire<br>
                curriculum and staff did not<br>
                disppoint. They were very hands-on<br>
                and I never had to wait ling for<br>
                assistanc. The agile team project, in<br>
                particular, was outstanding it took<br>
                my learning to the next level in a way<br>
                that on tutorial could ever hace. in<br>
                fact, I,ve often referred to it during<br>
                interviews as an example of my<br>
                developent experience. It certainly<br>
                helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>
                developer after receiving multiple<br>
                offers. 100% recommend! <sup>~</sup>
